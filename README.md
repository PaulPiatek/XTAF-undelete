# XTAF-undelete
Program to undelete folders and files on Xbox 360 HDDs.

Created years ago, works with 20GB Xbox360 harddrives.

The filesystem was called XTAF, because it is basically a FAT fs for Xbox (FATX) but little endian -> XTAF.

## Attention!
Best and safest way to use this program is to create an image file of your 360 drive and work with this image instead of directly working on the drive. There is no guarantee that the program works without errors.
